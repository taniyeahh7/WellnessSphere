# Wellness Sphere Web App

## About

The **Wellness Sphere** Web App is a project designed to provide a platform for promoting holistic well-being. Whether you're interested in fitness, mindfulness, or nutrition, this app aims to support your journey towards a healthier and balanced lifestyle.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to Run

To run the app in the development mode, follow these steps:

1. In the project directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Change directory to the client folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

3. Start the React app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Additionally, start the Python app:

   ```bash
   cd client
   python app.py
   ```

This will launch the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### Available Scripts

In addition to `npm start`, there are other useful scripts:

- #### `npm test`

  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
  See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- #### `npm run build`

  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
  Your app is ready to be deployed!

  See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

- #### `npm run eject`

  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

  If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

  You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
